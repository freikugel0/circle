It focuses on a clean, fast UI for browsing and posting short updates, similar to a lightweight social feed.

## Overview

Circle is designed as the frontend for a microblogging application.  
The goal of this project is to explore modern frontend patterns with TypeScript, React, and Vite, while building a simple social-style interface.

I'm using this project as:

- A portfolio piece to showcase your frontend skills
- A base to integrate with your own backend / API
- A playground for experimenting with UI, state management, or authentication

---

## Features

Current and planned features include:

- Timeline-style feed for short posts
- Interface for composing new posts
- User-centric layout (profile area, navigation, etc.)
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- TypeScript-first codebase for better reliability and refactoring

(You can update this section to match the exact features that are already implemented.)

## Tech Stack
